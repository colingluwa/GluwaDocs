# Environments

Gluwa is supported in two environments: sandbox and production. As a general rule, use the sandbox environment for testing purposes, then move to the live environment for production processing.

#### **Sandbox Environment**

The sandbox environment is a clone of the production environment. It is connected to [Rinkeby](https://www.rinkeby.io/), a test Ethereum network, for Gluwacoin and Testnet3 for Bitcoin.

Gluwa provides Faucets in sandbox Dashboard for you to deposit test coins into your Ethereum or Bitcoin address in the sandbox environment.  You can use the test coins to test your integration.

* Dashboard: [https://sandbox.dashboard.gluwa.com](https://sandbox.dashboard.gluwa.com)
* API: [https://sandbox.api.gluwa.com](https://sandbox.api.gluwa.com)

#### **Production Environment**
