# Buttons and Marks

The system provides several Gluwa button types and styles you can use in your app or website. In contrast to the Gluwa buttons, you use the Gluwa mark to communicate the availability of Gluwa as a payment option.

Don't create your own Gluwa button design or attempt to mimic the system-provided button designs.

## Button

Gluwa button let users know they can initiate Gluwa payment. Gluwa designed several types of buttons so that you can choose the button type that fits best with the design of your purchase experience.

## Mark

Use the Gluwa mark graphic to show that Gluwa is an available payment option when showing other payment options in a similar manner. The Gluwa mark is not a button; if you need a Gluwa button, choose one of the buttons described in [Button Types](buttons-and-marks.md#button-types).
