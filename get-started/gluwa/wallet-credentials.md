# Access Private Keys

## Get Ethereum Wallet Address and Private Key from Gluwa

1. Open the Gluwa mobile app.
2. Open the wallet with the password you used to create the wallet.
3. Navigate \`Menu -&gt; Private key and address\`
4. Submit your password again to review your private key and address.
5. You will see the private key and address of your Gluwacoin wallets \(e.g., USD-G, KRW-G\) which are Ethereum wallets. Note that you will see the same private key and address for all Gluwacoin wallets since they coexist in the same Ethereum wallet.
