## Cryptocurrency Wallet

A cryptocurrency wallet is a set of private and public keys. You can think of the public key as the username and the private key as its password. You may share your username, but you will lose the sole-control of your wallet if you share your password.

### Software Wallet

A software wallet is a program that stores a cryptocurrency wallet. Also, the program provides a user interface to use your cryptocurrency wallet.

There are two categories of software wallet based on how they store secret keys: custodial and non-custodial.

### Custodial Wallet

A custodial wallet provider holds a copy of your secret key. Since the provider has the secret key, they also have access to your funds in the wallet.

### Non-custodial Wallet

A non-custodial wallet does not share your secret key with anyone but you. Therefore, only you have control of your funds in the wallet.
